# code-quiz

a timed quiz using javascript fundamentals

## Task

this Challenge is to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## TODO

### Criteria

- Quiz should be timed.
- Quiz should have multiple choice questions.
- HTML should be dynamically rendered in JS
- Stores user's high scores

### User Journey

- Page loads
- User is presented with Start button
- User clicks start button
- A timer starts to count down and you are presented with the first question
- When you are presented with a question you will have your multiple choice answers
- When user clicks on answer (li or button) then move to next question
- When I click on an answer, then the selected answer is validated against the correct answer (how do we store correct answer for a question rendered)
- If answer is correct go to next question
- If answer is wrong subtract time from remaining time and go to the next question
- Game Over Logic
  - When all questions are answered (track current question)
    OR
  - When remaining time reaches 0
- When you answer all questions stop the timer and record that as your score and render form

Form

- field for initials or full name
- a message stating your score
- submit the form

On form submission

- store your score in local storage
